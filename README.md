# disclaimer module

Here you will find disclaimer module with custom Content Type, field_disclaimer that is already assigned to Article content type (this CT is one of the default Content types),
.js and .css files for popup functionality

This module also has unfinished part - new Field Type.
I left it with an idea to finish in the future but this part (Disclaimer field type) won't work at the moment.
(The struggle was an Entity Reference/Integer data type with error messages like "Wrong Primitive type" or "Value is not a valid entity")
